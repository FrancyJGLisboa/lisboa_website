abstract = "It is of global concern to adopt measures to mitigate land degradation caused by agricultural production systems. One of the strategies proposed is to replace degraded pastures with agrosilvopastoral systems which integrate three different land-use types: crop production, livestock pasture and forestry plantation (denoted iCLF). However, little is known about the differences between iCLF and other land use types in terms of soil microbial community structure. Distance matrices based on individual soil chemical properties and individual soil microbial variables were correlated by Procrustes analysis and these relationships yielded vectors of residuals depicting these correlations (matches). These vectors were used as univariate response variables in an ANOVA framework in order to investigate how the match sizes (the strength of correlation/covariance) between individual soil chemical properties and individual soil."
