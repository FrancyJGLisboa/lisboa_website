abstract = "Aims We used a Procrustean superimposition approach associated with regression analysis to test hypotheses regarding the relationship between plant communities and distinct below-ground compartments—soil chemis-try (SC) and soil microbial activity (SMA). Additionally, we evaluated litter chemical quality as an interface be-tween the above and below-ground compartments. Methods Plant community, and soil chemical and bio-chemical data from three post-mining degraded sites under reclamation and from one nearby forest site in the Brazilian Amazon Basin were analyzed. Results All studied sites presented distinct plant com-munity, litter quality, SC and SMA. Plant community consistently affected the below-ground variation in both SC and SMA compartments. The influence of litter quality was greater in the plant community ver-sus SMA relationship than in the plant community versus SC. Nevertheless, the SC affected significantly the SMA, but without influence of litter quality. Conclusions Differently from previous studies, our findings suggest that plant community and soil chemistry can affect the soil microbial activity independently. Spe-cifically for our study area, these results point to a rupture of the 'in nested' structure of the causal relationship between changes in vegetation, changes in the chemical litter quality, changes in the SC and the response of SMA.."
