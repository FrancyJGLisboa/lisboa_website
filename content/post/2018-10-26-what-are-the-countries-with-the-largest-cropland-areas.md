Even though productivity gains are important to meet the growing food demand worldwide, natural genetic limitations of crops highlight the importance of the availability of cropland areas to ensure food security. Thus, statistics on cropland area extension at both national and regional levels are important in the collective efforts to achieve the sustainable development goal of ending the hunger by 2030. FAOSTAT is claimed to be the largest agricultural statistics - related database in the world with country and regional level statistics being updated yearly.

The definition of cropland area in FAOSTAT database is the one representing the sum of arable land and permanent crops, and according to the most recent revision of the Inputs - Land Use domain, the world cropland area totals 6 billion hectares in 2015 (last available data). This global cropland area is fairly distant from the one recently released by the US Geological Survey (1.87 billion hectares). However, this huge discrepancy is most likely due to definition scope of cropland areas, for example, exclusion of pastures of cropland area definition could significantly decrease the final estimate of cropland area worldwide.

Following the recent update of the Agri-environmental indicator - Land Use domain in FAOSTAT, the value of 6 billion of hectares of cropland area represented 14.2% of the total global land area in 2015. Most of the cropland area is in Asia, being this region also the one with the largest proportion of land area occupied by cropland areas (18.76 %).

The total global cropland area extension gap between FAOSTAT and US. Geological Survey is not replicated at the national level. Both data sources show India, US, China, Russia, and Brasil as the top five largest cropland area across the globe. However, largest cropland area does not mean a cropland dominated land area at the national level. In FAOSTAT, Bangladesh, Republic of Moldova, Comoros, Burundi, and Tokelau figure as the countries with more than 60 % of the total land area occupied by cropland areas.

In conclusion, the most recent information on cropland areas in the world from FAOSTAT highlights India, US, China, Russia, and Brazil as important players in the role of ensuring food security. However, it is needed to take into consideration the share of cropland as countries with large shares are many times the ones with the need for more interventions toward efficient agriculture.
